Audiolizer
=============

[Demo](http://mattfeury.com/audiolizer)

Audiolizer is an idea summed up as a "reverse visualizer." It was conceived as project for GA Tech's CS 4475 Computational Photography. It was created, designed, and developed by myself and Henry Dooley. The project uses the JSyn pure Java audio library to generate the sound and runs as an applet.

While the ideas behind the code are solid, my personal contributions to this project are poorly written. The lack of consistent indentation should be the first give away. I was a student with only a year of undergrad CS under my belt, and, while I'm personally very proud of this project, I don't feel that it accurately represents my current skill level.

This code is available on Github for nostalgia's sake and also so I can reference as I move forward in creating awesome new music applications, e.g. [the Saucillator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mattfeury.saucillator.android).

Usage
------------

An ant build file is included for convenient building. Just run 'ant' from the command line and it should build, create the jar, and spin it up.

License
-----------

Really? Are you drunk? Go ahead. If you wanna be a pal, give me credit. This is also known as the "don't be an asshole" license.

JSyn is included freely as per [its licensing.](http://www.softsynth.com/jsyn/)

About me
------------

I enjoy creating music out of math. I also spend my days as a Software Engineer for [OpenStudy](http://openstudy.com/), writing kickass educational tools. Feel free to check out my projects at [mattfeury.com](http://mattfeury.com/)
